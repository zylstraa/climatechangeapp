# Climate Change: Just How Bad Is it?

Exploring multiple datasets, this app sets out to add numbers to the issues of Climate Change: the causes, effects, and action items taken globally as well as by individual country. Each tab and graph has the icon of the organization whose data it is using and can go to that site by clicking on the icon. There's also a downloadable pdf presentation to tell the story alongside usage of the Shiny app. This presentation includes a lot more information as well as articles for more reading and links to the author's Twitter and LinkedIn. The app can be accessed here: https://zylstraa.shinyapps.io/climatechange/


## Causes
There are 3 options to choose from: Looking at CO2 emissions globally, by nation, and deforestation data. The interactive graphs allow for exploration and extrapolation by the user. 

## Effects
Once again there are 3 options for the user to take a look at: Sea level rise & Flooding, Increase in Natural Disasters, and Threatened Species. The Natural Disasters graph is an interactive animated map that shows the change by each year. The Threatened Species graphs are broken out into fish, bird, mammal, and plant species.

## Action
Here the user can look at each country's electricity production by renewable (non hydro), hydroelectricity, and non-renewable sources. They can compare up to 3 countries via a drop down.
